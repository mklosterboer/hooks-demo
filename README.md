# React Hooks Demo
This repo is meant to show examples of Hooks being used for simple problems. I may expand this to include gotchas at some point. 

This was built mainly from examples on reactjs.org and overreacted.io. 

## Install and Run

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mklosterboer/hooks-demo.git

$ npm start
